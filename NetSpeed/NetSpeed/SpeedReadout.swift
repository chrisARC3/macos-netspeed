/// "X.X Mbps (Y.Y MBps)" (FR-6, format B — Mbps primary, MBps a secondary
/// parenthetical). Rendered with tabular digits in fixed-width fields so the
/// numbers don't shift as they change magnitude (NFR-3), and centered as a block
/// in the window, staying centered as it resizes (FR-17, v0.5).
///
/// The direction labels are right-aligned and ordered word-then-arrow, so the
/// words line up under each other and the fixed-width arrows align vertically in
/// a column beside the numbers. Each arrow is tinted with the shared blue/red
/// scheme (SpeedPalette) so it matches its line in the graph.
