        // the app (FR-16, wired up in Increment 3.4) — no "New Window" menu item

        // (FR-13, Increment 3.3). Like `.defaultSize`, `.defaultPosition` takes
        // effect only when there's no restored frame, so it sets the fresh-install
        // placement without disturbing 3.2's automatic restoration — every later
        // launch reopens where the window was last left. macOS keeps a window's
        // title bar clear of the menu bar, so `.topLeading` sits just below it.

        // Remember window position and size across launches (FR-11, FR-12) with
        // no explicit persistence code: a SwiftUI `Window` scene saves and restores
        // its frame through macOS's standard window restoration. This is the
        // SwiftUI-only, lightweight path (Increment 3.2); the accepted trade-off is
        // that it rides system window restoration (subject to the "Close windows
        // when quitting an application" setting) instead of a hand-rolled
        // UserDefaults frame, which would mean reaching into the AppKit NSWindow
        // we're deliberately not using. `.defaultSize` applies only on first
        // launch, before any frame has been saved.
