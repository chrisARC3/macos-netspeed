/// Polls the OS interface byte counters on a fixed interval, sums the
/// per-interval byte deltas across all physical network interfaces (BSD `en*`
/// — Ethernet, Wi-Fi, wired adapters), and publishes the result for the UI to
/// display. Console output is retained for debugging during Phase 2.
///
/// Interface scope (FR-10, requirements v0.4): we sum every `en*` interface so
/// the reading reflects *total* network throughput regardless of which interface
/// carries it — matching Activity Monitor. This catches several interfaces being
/// active at once (e.g. an SMB mount bound to Wi-Fi while the internet default
/// route is on Ethernet). Loopback and virtual interfaces (VPN `utun*`, AirDrop
/// `awdl*`/`llw*`, bridges) are excluded: VPN traffic is already counted once on
/// the physical interface it rides, so including the tunnel too would double-count.
///
/// Counter wrap: `getifaddrs` exposes 32-bit byte counters that wrap at 4 GiB.
/// A wrap — or an interface counter reset — shows up as `now < last`; we treat
/// that interval as 0 for that interface rather than underflowing `UInt64`.
